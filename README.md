visual playlist creator

- playlists visualized as cluters of tracks
- mousing over a cluster plays short samples so that you can be reminded of the feel of that playlist
- combine with [laughs](https://github.com/lowellbander/laughs) to suggest where a track should go
- yummy integration with [Leap Motion](https://www.leapmotion.com/)
- music needs more spatial integration
